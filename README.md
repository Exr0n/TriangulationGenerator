# TriangulationGenerator
A problem generator for a word problem, school assignment! NUS-19MATH301

Hi everyone, I'm working on this school project where we have to write trig word problems!  
This has got some trig in it (you have to triangulate the positions of nodes) but secretly has some graph traversial too!  
Check it out if you'd like!
